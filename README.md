# Pneumonia Detection

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered web application for detecting pneumonia from chest X-rays using a custom deep learning model. It features real-time predictions, confidence scores, and Grad-CAM heatmaps, with age and gender adjustments for personalized results.

## Related Work
- Existing solutions like CheXNet use pre-trained models for pneumonia detection.
- **Difference**: This project offers a custom CNN with interpretability via heatmaps and demographic tweaks, setting it apart from static pre-trained approaches.
